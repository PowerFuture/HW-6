% Dimensions
% Slab is 12 inches thick surrounded by air on each side
d = 12 * 2.54; %cm thick
dc = d/100; %meters Our critical dimension in this case is the whole slab
rNz = ceil(d); %This Nz represents real world size
rNz = rNz + 2;  % We are going to add air on each side of the problem.

%Material Vectors Initialized at Air
rER = ones([1 rNz]);

% Add our Slab materials to the model
