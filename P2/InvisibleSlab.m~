%  Problem
%    A radome is being deigned to protect an antenna.
%    Antenna operates at 2.4Ghz
%    radome is 1ft thick with a dielectric constant = 12
%    We want  to maximize transmission through dome
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Constants
c0 = 299792458;

% Frequency
f_max = 2.4e9; %2.4Ghz
labmda_max = f_max/c0;
% Dimensions
% Radome is 12 inches thick
d_radome = 12 * 2.54; %cm thick

% We need to place a Anti-Reflective Layer on each side of the Radome
e_radome = 12;
e_air = 1;
e_nonreflective = sqrt(e_radome*e_air);

n_nonreflective = sqrt(e_nonreflective);
d_nonreflective = f_max/(r*n_nonreflective);

dc = d_nonreflective/100; %meters Our critical dimension in this case the anti-reflectivelayer
rNz = ceil(d_radome + 2*d_nonreflective); %This Nz represents real world size
rNz = rNz + 2;  % We are going to add air on each side of the problem.

% Material Vectors Initialized at Air
rER = ones([1 rNz]);
rUR = ones([1 rNz]);  % I don't think we change this value at all....

% Add our Materials to the model
zstart = 1;
zend = ceil(d_nonreflective);
rER(zstart: zend) = e_nonreflective;

zstart = zend  

rER(ceil(d_nonreflective)+1:ceil(d_nonreflective)+1+ceil(d_radome)
